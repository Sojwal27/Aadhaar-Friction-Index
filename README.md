# Aadhaar Friction Index

> **⚠️ Work in Progress**: This project is currently under active development. Features and documentation will be updated regularly.

A data analysis project to measure and visualize friction in India's Aadhaar digital identity system across different states and demographic groups.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Aadhaar Friction Index (AFI)** aims to quantify the barriers and challenges citizens face when accessing Aadhaar-related services. By analyzing multiple data dimensions, this project creates a composite friction index that reveals regional disparities and helps identify areas requiring policy intervention.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze Aadhaar enrollment, demographic updates, and biometric activity across Indian states
- Identify hidden friction points in Aadhaar lifecycle services
- Quantify systemic stress and service burden
- Create visualizations highlighting regional and demographic disparities
- Develop a statistically validated composite friction index
- Support evidence-based policy and governance insights
